_Description: Enable WenQuanYi font in fontconfig?
 By default, bitmapped fonts are disabled in fontconfig setting because
 they are often lower quality. Enabling this option will bypass the
 system wide fontconfig setting and allow applications to use WenQuanYi
 font without affecting other bitmapped fonts.
